		There is so much in silence, the pause in-between voices desperately persuading the other to understand. During this auditory break, the voices do not rest: millions of them scream soundlessly at something, angry at the fact that they are not materialized. Some voices do get incredibly close to being released, but the beauty of it all is the repetitive act of voices being pushed forward but inevitably pulled back: the beauty is in the torture of dying to speak yet being so afraid that these voices would just hurt the situation even more instead of expressing thoughts as they intend. </div>
	
		<div class="second">
		Silence is a moment of not quite a surrender, but an acknowledgement: acknowledging that there is only so much verbal communication or even physical struggle can do, that every misunderstanding is born from Subjectivity, the King who controls the comprehension and miscomprehension  between beings, the inventor who created all that exists and does not exist ever since the first moment they are allowed to be perceived, the source of power all has to surrender to for the fact that without it nothing would function. </div>	

		<div class="third">
		Do not resent the limitations of Subjectivity.
			</div> 

		<div class="fourth">
			Be grateful that it is an endless string which ties every being or non-being together, allowing them to intertwine, collide, and acknowledge each other the way they do.
			Do not resent the limitations of Subjectivity.
